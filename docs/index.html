        <h2>About NodeSchool</h2>

        <p>NodeSchool is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: <b>creating a high quality programming curriculum</b> and to <b>host community learning events</b>. Our curriculum is focused around the "workshopper" format which was first created by
        <a href="http://substack.net/">Substack of the Internet</a> in Summer 2013 when he wrote the
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/stream-adventure">stream-adventure
        </a> workshopper.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The defining characteristic of the workshopper is the interactvity and automation. Workshoppers are made up of challenges of increasing difficulty. Each challenge starts by explaining a concept, and then presents a list of requirements for solving the challenge. Learners then try and write a computer program that satisfies the criteria.
