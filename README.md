_**All of our scheduled events are on
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/nodeschool-vancouver)**_

NodeSchool is a series of open source workshops that teach web
software skills. Individuals are encouraged to do the
[workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/) on their own or at one of the
NodeSchool events around the world. The workshopper tutorials are used
as the course curriculum, while mentors are here to help attendees
work through challenges. Learn more [here](http://nodeschool.io/vancouver/).

## Get in touch

Every community needs a reliable way to communicate. To make it easier, we have
a few ways for everyone to speak with each other. We've also included a max
response time for an organizer to respond.
